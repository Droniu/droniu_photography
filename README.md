Droniu Photography is my portfolio website for showcasing my photos.

I shoot mainly portraits & events.

Due to the purpose of the website it is frontend-heavy. Right now it consists mainly of top navbar and 3d carousel with tilt effect.

## Things to do in near future:
### Backend:
* Move photos/slides to backend
* Make loading screen variable (wait for photos to load)
* Admin page with possibility to add slides/album covers with photos
### Frontend:
* Add contact button and create contact page
* Make 2nd slide array for events (unless backend-generated slides are ready)
* Make navbar change content
* Fix carousel so that movement is not reversed at the beginning and the end of the array
* Add proper fonts
* Change the photos to proper size
* Click on the central tile should take to album page
* Choose & implement library for album pages
* Add hover animation on navbar
