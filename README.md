Droniu Photography is my webfolio for showcasing my portrait / event photos. Made using create-react-app.

Website uses Droniu Photography REST API, which is my default backend for storing photos and organizing them into catalogs.

## To-do list:

### First:
* Slides
* Sidebar
* Social icons
* Logo div
* Text & animations
* Api fetch loader

### Then:
* 'Back' arrow/button
* Contact Page
* Galleries

### Finally:
* Manage catalogs / admin ui
